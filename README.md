Note from the Dev:

Just a (very) simple personal homepage project built with React Router and using VS Code's copilot in Agent mode.

The purpose of the project was to develop a simple web page using AI tools with complete project access - which I generally refrain from.

So far I've found that while making cookie-cooker sweeping changes is somewhat easier - say build a component or a view from scratch with these or those features - fine detail goes a bit out the window. The agent often makes weird - to me - choices in code structure and will absolutely not organize components etc without explicit instruction. Changing and maitaining visual consistency and CSS details quickly became a challenge, for instance.
